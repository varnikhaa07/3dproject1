# 🌐 Three.js Rotating Cube

This project demonstrates a simple 3D scene created using Three.js, featuring a rotating cube illuminated by directional lighting.

## 🚀 Features

- A 3D cube that continuously rotates
- Custom scene background
- Perspective camera setup
- Directional light with adjustable intensity and position
- Real-time rendering using WebGL

## 🧱 Built With

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – JavaScript 3D library
- HTML5 + JavaScript (ES6 module syntax)

## 📁 Project Structure

- index.html – The main HTML file
- script.js – Contains the Three.js setup and animation logic

## 💡 How It Works

1. A scene is created with a black background.
2. A perspective camera is added to view the 3D space.
3. A cube is built using box geometry and a Lambert material with color and emissive properties.
4. Directional lighting is positioned to illuminate the cube.
5. A WebGL renderer displays the scene on the webpage.
6. An animation loop rotates the cube on both X and Y axes and continuously updates the view.

## ▶ How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the index.html file in a browser (preferably using a local server).
3. You’ll see a 3D cube rotating smoothly on the screen.
